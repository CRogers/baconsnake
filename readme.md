This is a two part exercise. There are checkpoint branches for each part:

* Start: `part1`
* Midpoint: `part2`
* Final solution: `part3`

To start:

1. `git checkout part1`
2. Follow the setup instructions on the readme page for that branch
3. Look at the goals section on the webpage after running. You can also checkout `part2` to see the behaviour you need to implement.
4. Repeat for part2
