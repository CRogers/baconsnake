Instructions
---

This is a two part exercise. There are checkpoint branches for each part:

* Start: `part1`/`part1-js`
* Midpoint: `part2`/`part2-js`
* Final solution: `part3`

The `partX` are coffeescript versions. The `partX-js` branches are javascript version. To start:

1. `git checkout part1` (or `part1-js` for the js version)
2. Follow the setup instructions on the readme page for that branch
3. Look at the goals section on the webpage after running `./gulp serve`. You can also checkout `part2` to see the behaviour you need to implement.
4. Repeat for part2
